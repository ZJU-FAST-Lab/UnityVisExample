# Creating a State Unit node

State Nodes are similar to [Subgraphs](vs-subgraphs.md), however for state graphs rather than for script graphs; you can nest a whole state graph into a single node in a parent script graph.

To create a state node:

1. Do one of the following:
   - Select **Nesting** **&gt; State Node** in the fuzzy finder.
     **Double-click** the node or use the Edit Graph button from its inspector to open the nested graph. 
   - From a graph:
     - Drag and drop the graph asset into your graph, or
     - Select it from the Graphs category in the fuzzy finder.
