# Update your version of Visual Scripting

Before you update to a new version of Visual Scripting, you should back up your data. For more information on backing up your Visual Scripting assets and settings, see [Create or restore a Visual Scripting backup](vs-create-restore-backups.md).

You should also confirm that the version is compatible with your current project and your needs. For example, you shouldn't use a package in the Preview state in a production environment. For more information on package states and the package lifecycle in Unity, see the [Unity User Manual page on package states and lifecycle](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-lifecycle.html).

To update your current version of Visual Scripting:

1. Go to **Window** &gt; **Package Manager**. 
2. In the Packages drop-down menu, ensure you have **In Project** selected.
3. In your list of packages, select **Visual Scripting**. 
4. Select **Update to `X.X.X`**, where `X.X.X` is the newest available version of Visual Scripting.
