# Developing application logic using Script Graphs

> [!NOTE]
> For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-bolt-163802).

Use Script Graphs to create interactions and logic in your project.

## Create a graph file 

Create a graph file to get started. For more information, see [Creating a new graph file](vs-create-graph.md).

## Add and connect nodes 

Once you have a graph file, [add a node](vs-add-node-to-graph.md) or [connect nodes together](vs-creating-connections.md) to start building logic. 

## Create Subgraphs 

Reuse logic by [adding a Subgraph to a Script Graph](vs-add-subgraph.md).

## Debug your graphs 

You can [use relations](vs-relations.md) to help you debug your scripts, or use Visual Scripting's [predictive debugging](vs-debugging.md) to help you catch problems.
