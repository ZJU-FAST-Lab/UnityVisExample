# Create a new blank graph using the Project window

You can create a new blank graph through the Project window in the Unity Editor. Your graph contains no starter nodes, and isn't connected to any existing components in your project.

For more information on other ways to create a new graph file, see [Creating a new graph file](vs-create-graph.md).

To create a new blank graph: 

1. (Optional) If your Project window isn't already open, go to **Window** &gt; **General** &gt; **Project**, or press CTRL + 5 (macOS: Cmd + 5). 

2. Right-click a folder in the Project window's folder list, or anywhere in the Project window's preview pane, and go to **Create** &gt; **Visual Scripting**. Select one of the following options: 

    * To create a new Script Graph, select **Script Graph**. 
    * To create a new State Graph, select **State Graph**. 

3. Enter a name for your new graph, and press Enter.

When you open your new graph file, you should see something like the image below:

## Next steps 

After you create your new Script Graph, attach it to a Script Machine to use it in your application. For more information, see [Attaching a graph file to a Script Machine or State Machine](vs-attach-graph-machine.md).
