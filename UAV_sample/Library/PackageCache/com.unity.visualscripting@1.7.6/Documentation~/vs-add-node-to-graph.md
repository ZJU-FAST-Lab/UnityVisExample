# Add a node to a Script Graph

All logic in a Script Graph starts with a node. 

> [!TIP]
> Depending on the method you used to create your Script Graph, you might already have two Event nodes in your graph: Start and Update. For more information on these nodes, see [Events node](vs-events-reference.md).

To add a node to a Script Graph: 

1. With a Script Graph [open in the Graph window](vs-open-graph-edit.md), right-click on an empty space in the Graph Editor to open the fuzzy finder. 
  For more information on creating Script Graphs, see [Creating a new graph file](vs-create-graph.md).

2. In the fuzzy finder, enter a search term into the Search bar or select a category from the list to find related nodes. Categories have an arrow (>) at the end of their entry in the fuzzy finder. 

3. Select the entry in the fuzzy finder for the node you want to add to your Script Graph. 
  Visual Scripting adds the node to your Script Graph at the location where you opened the fuzzy finder.

## Next steps

Once you've added a node to your graph, you can add additional nodes and [connect nodes in a Script Graph](vs-creating-connections.md) to create logic for your application.
