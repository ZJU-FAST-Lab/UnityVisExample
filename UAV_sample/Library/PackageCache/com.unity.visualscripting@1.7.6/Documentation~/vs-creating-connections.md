# Connect nodes in a Script Graph 

Connections control the flow of logic and data in a Script Graph's nodes. 

To connect nodes in a Script Graph: 

1. With a Script Graph [open in the Graph window](vs-open-graph-edit.md), either find an existing node where you want to make a connection, or [add a new node to your Script Graph](vs-add-node-to-graph.md).

2. Do one of the following: 

  - Select a port and point to a blank area in your graph to start the connection. Select again to open the fuzzy finder, then select a node entry to automatically add that node at the end of your connection. 

  - Select a port and point to an existing port on another node. Visual Scripting dims any incompatible ports or nodes. Select the port where you want to make the connection.

## Delete a connection

To delete a connection between two nodes: 

1. With a Script Graph open in the Graph window, right-click the port at either end of a connection to delete the connection. 


## Next steps 

Once you've connected nodes together, you can continue to [add nodes to your Script Graph](vs-add-node-to-graph.md). You can also [create and add variables](vs-add-variable-graph.md), [create node groups](vs-groups.md), or [add a Subgraph](vs-add-subgraph.md).
