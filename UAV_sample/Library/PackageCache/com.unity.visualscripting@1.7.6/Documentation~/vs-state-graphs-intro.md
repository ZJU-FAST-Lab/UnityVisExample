# Developing logic transitions using State Graphs

> [!NOTE]
> For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-bolt-163802).

You can use State Graphs to change behaviors of GameObjects based on specific conditions. 

## Create a new state 

After [creating a new graph file](vs-create-graph.md), you can [create states](vs-create-state.md) to tell Visual Scripting what a GameObject should do, and when. 

## Create a transition 

Use [transitions](vs-transitions.md) to tell Visual Scripting when a GameObject should change states. You can [create transitions](vs-creating-transition.md) between just about any state type, and there's no restriction on how many transitions you can create. 

## State Unit nodes 

You can use a [State Unit node](vs-state-unit-nodes.md) to nest a State Graph inside a Script Graph.
